### What worked well during unit 1?
I managed to transfer around 80% of my C knowledge to Python which is a lot more then I expected and I didn't make any syntax mistakes because of the transition, which is also great!!!
### What did not work well?
There was a lot of work so I often struggled with finding motivation to finish the easy but time consuming tasks, but in the end I think managing to overcome that will help me a lot in the future  because a lot of coding are just basics which take a lot of time even though they are not hard.
### What did you enjoy most during project unit 1?
I enjoyed the process of making success criteria becuase I am really into crypto currencies and I myself use 3 different ledgers so ther were so many features I always wanted to use while investing, but never had a chance to because they are not available on those. It was generally interesting because it was mostly creativity and not the complicated coding so it felt like a funactivity insted of an assignment. 
### What talent have you discovered or practiced during this unit?
I discovered that I am lot more creative than I initally thought and that I shouldn't listen to the steretypes where if a person likes science and math, they are deffinatelly not creative.
### What is working well in Computer Science for you?
So far I would say everything, except the amount of work that we need to do in different areas, becuase It was very stressful and I am not sure if I would've been able to do it if it was not at the beginning of the year and if we had other assignments at the same time.
### What can Dr. Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
Nothing really, just a suggestion in general would be to maybe from time to time when we have a little bit of free time, organize like quizzes or something like that where we would be splitted into random teams and then competed together against other teams, because I think that would be a good way to make a fun, useful and not a stressful activity where we can learn how to work together while not having a lot of pressure.
